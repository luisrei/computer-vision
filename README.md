Image Processing and Vision project regarding objects' detection and tracking.

# Introduction
First part of the exercise assumes that there is knowledge on the various camera's transformations to the world frame. Second part of the project work assumes complete lack of knowledge of the environment. Read more about the project [here](http://printart.isr.ist.utl.pt/piv/project/).

This is a way of showcasing basic knowledge on image processing techniques and incite the creation of a creative engineering solution to a complex problem.

# Datasets
To find the datasets used to test our code click [here](http://printart.isr.ist.utl.pt/piv/project/datasets/proj2017/). Each one of the datasets has in  itself a collection of RGB and depth images from a couple of cameras sharing a common environment.
